## My device / MIDI Mixer isn't working! 

Make sure that **only** MIDI Mixer is using your device. If you have another program open that can use or make changes to your device, try closing it.

Another easy solution could be unplugging and replugging your device from your computer. Or maybe it's possible to reset your specific device to factory settings.

[Try and uninstall your device drivers and then re-install them.](faq.md#how-do-i-uninstall-and-re-install-drivers)

If that doesn't work, then check if your device needs specific drivers to function. You can usually find those on the official website for your device. If you already have those specific drivers, then also try and uninstall and then re-install them.

Even a computer restart could be the simple fix that's needed. And in rare cases, trying another computer port or another cable might fix the issue.

If all fails, let us know in on the [Discord server](https://discord.midi-mixer.com/) in `#support`, and we'll try to help you get it working.

It's most helpful if you start by telling us the steps you've already tried to resolve the issue, and which device you have.

**If you don't tell us what you've tried or which device you have, we might assume that you haven't checked the FAQ yet and ask you to look at that first.**
