  audio.

# Overview

Plugins provide you with the ability to extend MIDI Mixer and leverage its core concepts to provide control for any application with generic rules that can apply to any MIDI device. Control apps, games, or even hardware like [Philips Hue lighting](https://github.com/midi-mixer/plugin-hue), helping other users get the most out of their device.

**Plugins are strongly encouraged to be open source**, and MIDI Mixer itself has a number of "official" open source plugins to use as examples over on [GitHub](http://github.com/midi-mixer).
