# Use a preset

**Presets** within MIDI Mixer are curated custom **Profiles** that are included within the app itself. They are most commonly compatible with the out-of-the-box configuration for the target device, helping users to plug in a new device and have it immediately recognised and set up by MIDI Mixer.

{% hint style="info" %}
If your device doesn't have a preset yet or you need to support a custom configuration, it's easy to [create your own profile](create-a-profile/).
{% endhint %}

## Loading a preset

To load a preset, you must have a compatible device. For example, the **Behringer X-TOUCH MINI** preset is only loadable if you have a MIDI device with the name **X-TOUCH MINI**.

If you're loading MIDI Mixer for the very first time, the app will try to match any MIDI devices it can find to custom presets within the app. If it finds one, it will also try to automatically load that preset.

If this hasn't worked, you may have to manually find the preset on the **Profiles** page and click the **Load** button to activate the profile.

If you're still having troubles, try some of the troubleshooting steps in the [FAQ](../faq.md).

## Presets compared to profiles

The difference between a preset and a profile within the app is that presets have a locked **Input** and **Output** so that they can only be used with compatible devices.
