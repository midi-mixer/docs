# Share a profile

## Creating a share link

To share \(similar to exporting\) a profile with another person, you can click the **Share** button when viewing your profile.

This will pop up a dialog box with a URL that you copy and give to another person.

Share links will last forever, but do not update; if you change your profile, you'll have to generate a new link in order to share the latest version.

## Using a share link

To import a profile that's been shared by another user, enter the share link you've been given in to any web browser.

{% hint style="info" %}
A share link should always begin with `midi-mixer://share/`.
{% endhint %}

Once you enter the link, your browser will prompt you with a warning letting you know that it's going to open within the MIDI Mixer application.

After clicking **Open**, the MIDI Mixer UI should show and open your newly-imported profile! ðŸŽ‰
